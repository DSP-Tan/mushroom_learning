#This error might come up after you set your new  key

#To remedy this you must do 
gcloud auth login
# and then enter your details.

#Also ensure that echo $GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS points to the
#key that is actually linked on gcp. So check the cloud project for keys,
#the associated users, and then the numbers.

# Currently I don't know where this env variable is set, so I just gotta set

# This has not worked

# Here is a useful command which tells you about the environment variables

gcloud auth application-default login

# I think what fixed it was resetting the $GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS
# in the aliases.
# Because even if you set it in the terminal, when you run a python this opens
# a new environment. Then I restarted my computer and it worked.
So make sure that in ~/.aliases you have the correct key set.
