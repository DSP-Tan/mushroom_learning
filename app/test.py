    This will return the dicionary item of the species
    with the highest score. If other is set to True this
    includes the 'Other' species, if it is set to false
    the other is not included.

    The weights have to be set to the accuracy/or some metric
    of each model, so that later on you do not take as the maximum
    score a high score from a bad model.

    The weights only come into play after you first find the maximum,
    so the implementation is not as straight forward as it seems. You
    could just have an option where the weights are only applied when
    a certain flag is given. Anyway, for now we do not have the weights
    and so we will continue without them but with this reminder.
