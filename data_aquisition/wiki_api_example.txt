Here is an example api request:
https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&prop=revisions&rvprop=content&rvsection=0&titles=amanita%20muscaria
In JSON format it's better:
https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?format=json&action=query&prop=revisions&rvprop=content&rvsection=0&titles=amanita%20muscaria

You can view that JSON format with a JSON viewer.

This works when you just paste it into a browser but not when you curl it.

rvsection = 0       specifies to only return the lead section.
action    = parse   This specifies that you get the HTML
action    = query   This specifies we want to fetch data from and about MediaWiki.
format    = json    Gives a JSON like we like.

But this ends up being rather unstructured (see notebook). So we will read more about it in these
articles:
