       " \"Despite its easily distinguishable features, ''Amanita muscaria'' is a fungus with several known variations, or subspecies. These subspecies are slightly different, some having yellow or white caps, but they are all usually called fly agarics, and they are most of the time recognizable by their notable white spots. Recent DNA fungi research, however, has shown that some of these variations are not the same species at all, such as the [[peach-colored fly agaric]] (''Amanita persicina'') for example, but the common name 'fly agaric' clings on.\",\n",
       " '',\n",
       " \"Although poisonous, death due to poisoning from ''A. muscaria'' ingestion is quite rare. [[Parboiling]] twice with water draining weakens its toxicity and breaks down the mushroom's psychoactive substances; it is eaten in parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. All ''Amanita muscaria'' varieties, but in particular ''A. muscaria'' var. ''muscaria'', are noted for their [[hallucinogenic]] properties, with the main psychoactive constituents being the neurotoxins [[ibotenic acid]] and [[muscimol]]. A local variety of the mushroom was used as an intoxicant and [[entheogen]] by the [[indigenous peoples of Siberia]] and by the [[Sámi]], and has a religious significance in these cultures. There has been much speculation on possible traditional use of this mushroom as an intoxicant in other places such as the Middle East, Eurasia, North America, and Scandinavia.\"]"
